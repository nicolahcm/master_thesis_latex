I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark

you're probably due for more error messages, and you

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be

you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
